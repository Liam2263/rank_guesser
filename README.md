SCRIPT FOR RLBOT
Rank Guesser guesses the rank of one team, how does it know this one team you may ask?
Decoys. Decoys are bots we put against the team of bots we want to guess the rank of. They help us determine the rank.

List of currently supported decoys: Botimus Prime, Necto, and Nexto

You can have uneven teams technically speaking, not recommended though.
This project is currently being developed whenever I have time, and is just a small fun little project.

How to use? (Download RankGuesser first)
Head over to RLBotGUI, make sure you have rlbot installed. If you don't have RLBot installed check out rlbot.org
Anyways, in the RLBotGUI you should see an "Add" button with a + icon. Click that, click "Load Folder" and then select the RankGuesser folder. Enable the script by scrolling down to the scripts section in the GUI and simply enable it. 
There you go!
